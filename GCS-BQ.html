    <p>
      I've been doing more data plumbing work lately, and having spent some time learning about Amazon Lambda and Google Cloud Functions, I thought it might be a good opporunity to use them for what are simple, discrete tasks.

      The discovery I've made as of late is that Cloud Functions can be triggered by a Cloud Storage bucket change. Before this you needed to interface with Google Pub Sub for this type of integration to work.
