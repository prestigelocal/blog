    <h2>base64-url</h2>
    <p>
      Today I wanted to explore whether I could add a "Share" feature on a
      markdown editor I'm building called
      <a href="https://apolloskine.netlify.app/">apolloskine</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that base64 encoding is an acceptable solution. But does this
      string need to be encoded to be parsed in a url? Turns out it does which
      is where the npm package
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/base64-url">base64-url</a> comes
      along.
    </p>
    <pre>
      import base64url from 'base64-url';

      const decodedFromText = base64url.encode(content);
      const parsedFromUrl = base64url.decode(content);
    </pre>
    <p>
      I'm assuming there are some limitations with this approach, like
      potentially a limit on the url length? I'm sure its fine for my simple
      note taking app.
